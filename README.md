# Remote-Controlled-Car
This project involves the development of a remote control (RC) car designed using Arduino UNO. The RC car can be controlled wirelessly via a Bluetooth module or autonomously navigate to a designated location using lane assist and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) features, which are planned for future incorporation. The car is constructed with the following components:

Arduino UNO: Serves as the main controller.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Used for obstacle detection and avoidance.

DC Motors and L293D Motor Controller: Facilitate the car's movement.

Bluetooth Module: Enables wireless communication with a smartphone.

Upon completion, the RC car will be capable of automatic navigation to a specified destination without user intervention.
